# Anti-Adobe genuine service alert

A simple python code that runs in the background and automatically terminates the annoying adobe genuine alert (`AdobeGCClient.exe`) when opened.


## Requirements
python v3.6+ should work.
```
pip install psutil WMI
```

## Note
You could end the application via Task Manager, it should be called either anti-adobe.exe or python.exe idk.
