# Anti-Adobe genuine service alert

A simple python code that runs in the background and automatically terminates the annoying adobe genuine alert (`AdobeGCClient.exe`) when opened.

## Execution
Run the .pyw or .exe file, based on how much you trust me. Both run the same code. ðŸ™‚

## Requirements
python v3.4+ should work.
```
pip install WMI
```

## Note
You could end the application via Task Manager, it should be called either anti-adobe.exe or python.exe idk.
